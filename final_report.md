## 📍 Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement a **Multi-Agent Architecture** that:
- Conducts **market research** for a given company/industry.
- **Generates AI/ML/GenAI-based use cases** based on the research.
- **Collects datasets/resources** relevant to the proposed solutions.
- Presents the results in a streamlined and professional manner.

---

## 🏗️ Methodology

The project follows a **Multi-Agent** pipeline, where each agent is responsible for a specific task:

### 1. Research Agent
- **Task**: Understand the industry the company operates in, and their key offerings.
- **Method**: 
  - Perform a Google search to retrieve the company's website or profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, Crunchbase).
  - Extract high-level information about the industry type (e.g., Retail, Healthcare, Manufacturing) and company focus areas (e.g., supply chain, customer experience).

---

### 2. Market Standards & Use Case Generation Agent
- **Task**: Propose relevant AI, ML, and GenAI use cases.
- **Method**: 
  - Perform web searches like “AI and GenAI use cases in [Industry] industry”.
  - Scrape the first few pages (paragraphs) using **BeautifulSoup**.
  - Extract **short, concise, and actionable use cases** rather than copying full paragraphs.
  - Apply **keyword filtering** to prioritize AI/GenAI relevance (keywords: AI, GenAI, Machine Learning, Automation).

### 3. Resource Asset Collection Agent
- **Task**: Find datasets or resources to support the use cases.
- **Method**:
  - Search for datasets on platforms like Kaggle, HuggingFace, GitHub.
  - Store all relevant links in a clean, clickable **markdown file**.

---

### 4. Streamlit Deployment
- **Task**: Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.
- **Method**:
  - Build a **Streamlit app** where users can input the company name or industry.
  - Display outputs: industry research, generated use cases, dataset links.

## 🧪 Results

Example (for a **Retail** company):

- **Industry Identified**: Retail & E-Commerce
- **Key Offerings**: Online marketplace, personalized customer shopping
- **Generated Use Cases**:
  - AI-powered dynamic pricing engine
  - GenAI-based personalized customer chatbots
  - Inventory demand forecasting using ML
  - Fraud detection using anomaly detection models
- **Datasets**:
  - [Retail Product Sales Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
  - [Customer Review Dataset - HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets)

## 📝 Conclusions

- The **Multi-Agentic System** successfully breaks down the problem into specialized tasks.
- **Short and relevant use cases** improve understanding and actionability compared to traditional large paragraphs.
- **Dynamic generation** ensures the system adapts to different industries.
- Deploying on **Streamlit** provides an intuitive way for users to interact with the system.
- **Fallback mechanisms** (default use cases) ensure robustness if web scraping fails.
