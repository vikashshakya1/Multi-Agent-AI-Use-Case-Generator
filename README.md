# 📄 Market Research & Use Case Generation Multi-Agent System

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a **Multi-Agent System** that performs:
- **Market Research**: Understands the company's industry and focus areas.
- **Use Case Generation**: Proposes AI, ML, and GenAI use cases tailored to the industry.
- **Resource Collection**: Provides datasets and references to help implement the solutions.

The solution is deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive experience.

## 🧠 Multi-Agent System Flow

1. **Research Agent**:
   - Uses web search to understand the industry and key offerings of a company.
2. **Market Standards Agent**:
   - Extracts short, pinpointed use cases related to AI, ML, and GenAI.
3. **Resource Asset Agent**:
   - Fetches datasets/resources to support the generated use cases.

➡️ **All findings are compiled into clean outputs, with clickable references.**

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/instaresz-assignment.git
cd instaresz-assignment
```

### 2. Install required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you face errors like "No module named streamlit" or "No module named googlesearch-python", install manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit googlesearch-python beautifulsoup4 requests
```

## 🚀 Running the Project

### 1. Streamlit App (Recommended)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

It will open a browser window at `http://localhost:8501`.

### 2. Direct Script (Backend only)

```bash
python main.py
```

Outputs will be saved under the `outputs/` folder.
